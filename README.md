# Printf to cout

This simple python script converts printf statements to cout statements.

It ignores format specifiers (except for %x). If you want to add that functionality please submit a pull request.

## Use 

    python3 converter.py <path/to/file>

Converted output is printed to standard output.
Please check the result for correctness. If you find a scenario where the script fails, please add it to the test cases and submit a pull request.

## Testing
    python3 tester.py
